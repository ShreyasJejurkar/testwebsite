But some of them don\u2019t like her as she keeps eye on your daily usage of computer and based on that she gives you a suggestion about different things and stuff. So most of them disable Cortana in Windows 10. And also some of the people didn\u2019t like the big search box at the bottom. If you\u2019re one of them then today&#8217;s post is for you. Follow the steps below and remove it from the taskbar and get a feel like Windows 7 taskbar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Steps <\/strong><br \/>\n1. Right click on the taskbar.<br \/>\n2. Then click on \u201csearch\u201d option from the menu and click hide.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mccshreyas.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/07\/savedpicture-2016731125619.png\"><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full;\" src=\"http:\/\/mccshreyas.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/07\/savedpicture-2016731125619.png\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><br \/>\n3. And now the search box is now hidden. And it\u2019s not completely gone.<\/p>\n<p>You can still search, just press the start button on the keyboard. And then type something, once you start typing the search box get invoke and will give you search result.<br \/>\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t provided any option to completely disable or remove that search box. And also I personally don\u2019t suggest it do that. Because it\u2019s quite helpful if you\u2019re are finding something. And also it indexes full computer and not only specific folder or drive. So enjoy it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In today\u2019s post, I am going to tell a simple method by which you can hide the search box from taskbar of Windows 10.
