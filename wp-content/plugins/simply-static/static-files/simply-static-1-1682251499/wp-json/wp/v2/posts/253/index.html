But you might also experience that Xender app for Windows Phone is still crashing a lot while sharing content. So I will suggest you to use Zapya app on Windows phone to share content. Don&#8217;t worry this app is also available for other platforms. And Zapya isn&#8217;t crashing while sharing ( although there is big data transmission).<br \/>\nSo if you haven&#8217;t downloaded Zapya app for Windows Phone then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/store\/apps\/zapya\/9nblggh3v9m6\">click here <\/a>to download it from the store. Or you may also search in store for Zapya app. It&#8217;s must that both phones should have a Zapya app install. If other phone doesn&#8217;t have to install zapya app then can download it from <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.dewmobile.kuaiya.play&amp;hl=en\">Android store<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apk4fun.com\/apk\/38358\/\">APK file <\/a>from here. I will suggest you to download <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apk4fun.com\/apk\/38358\/\">APK file (Apk4fun.com) <\/a>. B&#8217;coz consider that your friend&#8217;s mobile doesn&#8217;t have Zapya app. So you can send that APK file of Zapya app to friends mobile through Bluetooth ( it doesn&#8217;t take too much time). So that he can install Zapya app on his ( maybe Android ) mobile through APK file and can share content easily.<br \/>\nHow to share content through Zapya app.<br \/>\n1. First a fall open Zapya app on both phone ( Android and Windows Phone).<br \/>\n2. Now in the Android phone. Tap on double arrow sign bottom right corner. And click on create connection or group.<br \/>\n3. As soon as you tap on to create a connection, Android mobile will turn on Hotspot on mobile.<br \/>\n4. Then connect Windows Phone to Android Mobile Hotspot through Wi-Fi. And then open Zapya app.<br \/>\n5. And now you will notice that the Windows phone Zapya app will automatically try to connect to Android phone( if not then tap on infinity sign at the bottom) ( at top of the Zapya app you will see &#8220;Joining&#8221; ) and it will connect.<br \/>\n6. And now you can share content with another phone. You can tap on &#8216;X&#8217; sign at the top to close groups.<br \/>\nIf you&#8217;re facing any problem while doing this, then don&#8217;t hesitate to ask questions in comment section<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In my today&#8217;s post, I will tell you how to share and receive content from another phone through Zapya app on Windows phone.
