It&#8217;s great and easy platform to interact with. One of the initial problem that I face is that there is no column showing buy\/purchase date of stock on holdings screen. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/console.zerodha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">console<\/a>, there is no dedicated column for buy\/purchase date of stock. But I found there is other option through which we can see the buy date of given stock. Following are the steps that we need to follow in order to see buy\/purchase date of stock. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Steps <\/strong>&#8211; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-2\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:100%;\">\n<ol><li>Login to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/console.zerodha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>console<\/strong><\/a> with your account credentials. <\/li><li>Navigate to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/console.zerodha.com\/portfolio\/holdings\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>holdings<\/strong><\/a> tab on console. There you will see list of stock that you have hold for the particular period. <\/li><li>Hover cursor over one of the stock name, and you will see three dots appearing there for extra options like below image. <\/li><\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mccshreyas.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/10\/image.png?w=355\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-701\" width=\"383\" height=\"55\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Click on three dots and select <strong>View breakdowns\/tags<\/strong> option. <br>5. Once you click, the popup window will appear and in that table you will see the buy\/purchase date of stock in the first column itself. If you have sell\/buy the given stock multiple times then you might see multiple entries there. The latest one will be shown at the top. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see the date is quite hidden in different option and need to dig deeper one level to know the date of purchase of given stock. I hope going forward, zerodha team will add a dedicated column to show the purchase date. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is what I wanted to share with this post. If found useful, please share. If you face any problem while performing above steps, let me know in comment section below. <br>Thanks for reading&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recently I started investing with zerodha platform.
