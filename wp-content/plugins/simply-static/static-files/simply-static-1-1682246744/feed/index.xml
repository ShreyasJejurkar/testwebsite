										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Docker is a popular tool for packaging and deploying applications in containers, which are lightweight and portable execution environments. One of the key benefits of using Docker is the ability to limit the resources that a container can use, such as CPU and memory. This can be useful for optimizing the performance of your containers and ensuring that they do not consume too many resources on the host machine.</p>



<p>To set a memory limit when running a Docker container, you can use the <code>--memory</code> flag followed by the amount of memory you want to allocate to the container. For example, to allocate 256MB of memory to a container, you would run the following command:<br><br><code>docker run --memory 256m &lt;image&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code><br><br>You can also specify the memory limit in bytes using the <code>--memory-swap</code> flag, which sets the total amount of memory (RAM and swap) that the container can use. For example, to allocate 256MB of memory and an additional 256MB of swap space to a container, you would run the following command:<br><br><code>docker run --memory 256m --memory-swap 512m &lt;image&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code><br><br></p>



<p>Keep in mind that setting a memory limit for a container does not guarantee that the container will be able to use all of the allocated memory. If the host machine does not have enough available memory, the container may not be able to use all of the allocated memory.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that setting a memory limit for a container can affect its performance, as the container may not be able to use all of the available memory on the host machine. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate memory limit based on the needs of the container and the resources available on the host machine.</p>



<p>Overall, setting a memory limit for a Docker container is a useful way to optimize the performance of your containers and ensure that they do not consume too many resources on the host machine. By carefully managing the resources available to your containers, you can ensure that they run smoothly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Have you ever wished you could quickly open your favorite website with just a few keystrokes? Well, you can! Chrome allows you to assign shortcut keys for opening websites, making it easy to access them without having to manually type in the URL or click on a bookmark. Here&#8217;s how to do it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Chrome and navigate to the website you want to create a shortcut for.</li>



<li>In the address bar, click on the icon to the left of the website&#8217;s URL.</li>



<li>Drag the icon to your desktop or to the location where you want to create the shortcut.</li>



<li>A dialog box will appear asking if you want to create a shortcut. Click on &#8220;Create&#8221; to create the shortcut.</li>



<li>Right-click on the newly created shortcut and select &#8220;Properties&#8221; from the context menu.</li>



<li>In the Properties window, click on the &#8220;Shortcut&#8221; tab.</li>



<li>In the &#8220;Shortcut key&#8221; field, press the key combination you want to use as the shortcut. For example, if you want to use the &#8220;Ctrl+Shift+W&#8221; combination, press and hold the Ctrl and Shift keys, and then press the W key.</li>



<li>Click on &#8220;Apply&#8221; and then &#8220;OK&#8221; to save your changes.</li>
</ol>



<p>Now, whenever you want to open the website, you can use the shortcut key combination you assigned to open it in Chrome. This can be a real time-saver if you frequently visit the same websites and want to access them quickly.</p>



<p>To use the shortcut key, simply press and hold the keys you assigned as the shortcut (e.g. Ctrl and Shift, in the example above) and then press the final key (e.g. W, in the example above). The website will open in a new tab in Chrome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the world continues to grapple with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are understandably concerned about the possibility of a recession. While recessions are a normal part of the business cycle and most economies have recovered from past recessions, they can still be difficult and disruptive.</p>



<p>One of the main challenges of a recession is the impact it can have on employment and income. During a recession, many people may lose their jobs or see their incomes decline, which can lead to reduced spending and further economic contraction. This can be particularly difficult for those who are already struggling financially or who do not have a financial safety net.</p>



<p>Another concern during a recession is the impact it can have on businesses. Many businesses may struggle to survive during a recession, as demand for their products and services may decline and they may have difficulty accessing credit or financing. This can lead to business closures, which can have a ripple effect on the economy as a whole.</p>



<p>While it is natural to be worried about the possibility of a recession, it is important to remember that most economies have recovered from past recessions and have achieved long-term growth. Additionally, governments and central banks often implement measures to try to mitigate the impacts of a recession and support the economy.</p>



<p>It is also worth keeping in mind that recessions can serve a useful purpose by helping to correct imbalances in the economy. For example, a recession may help to reduce excess capacity in industries that have become oversaturated, or it may help to reduce inflationary pressures by slowing down the growth of prices.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while a recession can be difficult and disruptive, it is important to remain hopeful and to take steps to protect ourselves and our businesses as much as possible. By staying informed and prepared, we can better navigate the challenges of a recession and come out stronger on the other side.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you are a web developer or a software engineer, it’s most likely you are using Visual Studio code as your code editor. Yeah, it&#8217;s fantastic and easy to use. But I wondered when I found that there is no default shortcut key for most used options in git workflow, which pulls changes from upstream. So I decided to have a shortcut for pulling changes from upstream for both the current branches and different branches and also I though I should write a blog post around this just to let people know how to do that. So, let’s get started….</p>



<p>Steps</p>



<ol type="1">
<li>Open Visual Studio Code and go to File à Preference à Keyboard shortcuts alternatively you can press CTRL + K S to open it.<br><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-881" style="width: 500px;" src="https://shreyasjejurkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/KeyboardShortcut-1.png" alt=""></li>



<li>Once you open it, you will see a lot of options there. Basically, these are the various operations for which you can assign a keyboard shortcut. So instead of getting lost in all options, at the top, you will see a search bar where you can search for a particular action in our case we will type “git pull” (without quotes)<br><br><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-885" style="width: 400px;" src="https://shreyasjejurkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SearchGitPull-1.png" alt="search git pull option "></li>



<li>Once you search that you will see the first 2 entries of “git pull” and “git pull from”. And next to it you will see an empty cell under the Key Bindings column. You can double-click on that and press the key that you want to assign for that particular operation. In my case I will assign git pull to “ALT + E” and git pull from to “CTRL + ALT + E” as you can see below.<br><br><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-887" style="width: 600px;" src="https://shreyasjejurkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShortcutAssignment-1.png" alt="shortcut assignment"><br><br><br>So, this is all that we have to do. Now next time when you want to pull changes, instead of going the usual way, on the keyboard you can just press the shortcut key whatever you assign in the previous step.<br>I know this isn’t rocket science, but still, it saves some seconds and feels great and productive!<br>In case you face any issues while performing the above steps, please let me know in the comment section below.<br><br><br><br><br>Thanks! </li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you are a Web developer and working on a Full Stack application, you might have notice that the browser ( in my case Chrome) does send prefetch requests to your API endpoints before the actual API calls.</p>



<p>This is actually useful to improve performance but this can be very confusing when you are debugging applications from the front-end to the back-end and monitoring API calls in the network tab. Prefetch requests just clutter the network tab and we miss our actual XHR request to see what is happening. </p>



<p>So in this post, I will tell you the way through which you would be able to filter out prefetch requests from the network tab and can able to focus on actual XHR API calls. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Steps </strong></p>



<ol><li>Open Chrome developer tools by right-clicking on the page and clicking on inspecting or by pressing the shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + I. </li><li>Navigate to the Network tab (4th one most likely). </li><li>And in the filter textbox type <code>-method:OPTIONS</code>.We add a filter for HTTP OPTIONS method because prefetch calls use HTTP OPTIONS. <br><br></li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://shreyasjejurkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image.png" alt="prefetch filter" class="wp-image-865" width="297" height="188"/></figure>



<p>Once you perform the above steps, all prefetch API calls will be filtered out and you will only see XHR calls. </p>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are working with ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core projects in Visual Studio for developing web applications, then you might have come across this wired issue in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>The issue is whenever you start a debugging session (F5) inside Visual Studio for web projects, it always opens a new browser window (maybe chrome/edge based on your default preferences) for each debugging session. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a good experience, because most of us developers have an already open browser window that actually opens most of the time to search for bug fixes or create PR to GitHub or Azure DevOps. So having 2 separate browser windows puts a lot of pressure on RAM. And also it&#8217;s not like the chrome opens faster each time, every time it takes some initial seconds to open and then load the actual project in it.</p>
<p>So in this blog post, I will let you know the steps needed for avoiding a new window each time and making Visual Studio actually open in a new tab inside an already open browser window.</p>
<p>Steps &#8211;</p>
<ol>1. Open Visual Studio and navigate to Tools -&gt; Options.</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857" src="https://shreyasjejurkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vs-options.png" alt="tools-&gt;options settings vs" width="868" height="524" /></p>
<ol>2. After that in the Projects and Solutions section go to Web projects. There check the checkbox which is highlighted below.</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" src="https://shreyasjejurkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/settings-1.png" alt="third checkbox tick" width="976" height="682" /></p>
<ol>3. Then go to Debugging -&gt; General tab. And uncheck the checkbox which is highlighted below.</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-858" src="https://shreyasjejurkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/settings-2.png" alt="debugging general settings" width="1101" height="688" /></p>
<ol>4. And then lastly to save these changes, click on the Ok button on the window.</ol>
<p>And that&#8217;s it. These two changes will make sure the Visual Studio will open the new debugging tab in the same browser window instead of opening new.</p>
<p>I hope this post helps to solve this issue. In case of any problems, please let me know in below comment section.</p>
<p>Thank you&#8230;</p>

<p>I would suggest going through them one by one looking at their content and playlist section and if you are interested give them a sub! Along the time, I will keep this list updated, if I missed someone, please let me know in the comment section below! </p>

<p>Recently I started investing with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zerodha.com/" target="_blank">zerodha </a>platform. It&#8217;s great and easy platform to interact with. One of the initial problem that I face is that there is no column showing buy/purchase date of stock on holdings screen. </p>



<p>Also on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://console.zerodha.com/" target="_blank">console</a>, there is no dedicated column for buy/purchase date of stock. But I found there is other option through which we can see the buy date of given stock. Following are the steps that we need to follow in order to see buy/purchase date of stock. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Steps </strong>&#8211; </p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-2">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%;">
<ol><li>Login to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://console.zerodha.com/" target="_blank"><strong>console</strong></a> with your account credentials. </li><li>Navigate to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://console.zerodha.com/portfolio/holdings" target="_blank"><strong>holdings</strong></a> tab on console. There you will see list of stock that you have hold for the particular period. </li><li>Hover cursor over one of the stock name, and you will see three dots appearing there for extra options like below image. </li></ol>
</div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://mccshreyas.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/image.png?w=355" alt="" class="wp-image-701" width="383" height="55" /></figure></div>



<p>4. Click on three dots and select <strong>View breakdowns/tags</strong> option. <br>5. Once you click, the popup window will appear and in that table you will see the buy/purchase date of stock in the first column itself. If you have sell/buy the given stock multiple times then you might see multiple entries there. The latest one will be shown at the top. </p>



<p>As you can see the date is quite hidden in different option and need to dig deeper one level to know the date of purchase of given stock. I hope going forward, zerodha team will add a dedicated column to show the purchase date. </p>



<p>So this is what I wanted to share with this post. If found useful, please share. If you face any problem while performing above steps, let me know in comment section below. <br>Thanks for reading&#8230;.</p>
