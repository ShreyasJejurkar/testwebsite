<p>Recently I started investing with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zerodha.com/" target="_blank">zerodha </a>platform. It&#8217;s great and easy platform to interact with. One of the initial problem that I face is that there is no column showing buy/purchase date of stock on holdings screen. </p>



<p>Also on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://console.zerodha.com/" target="_blank">console</a>, there is no dedicated column for buy/purchase date of stock. But I found there is other option through which we can see the buy date of given stock. Following are the steps that we need to follow in order to see buy/purchase date of stock. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Steps </strong>&#8211; </p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-2">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%;">
<ol><li>Login to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://console.zerodha.com/" target="_blank"><strong>console</strong></a> with your account credentials. </li><li>Navigate to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://console.zerodha.com/portfolio/holdings" target="_blank"><strong>holdings</strong></a> tab on console. There you will see list of stock that you have hold for the particular period. </li><li>Hover cursor over one of the stock name, and you will see three dots appearing there for extra options like below image. </li></ol>
</div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://mccshreyas.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/image.png?w=355" alt="" class="wp-image-701" width="383" height="55" srcset="https://shreyasjejurkar.github.io/testwebsite/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image.png 355w, https://shreyasjejurkar.github.io/testwebsite/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image-300x43.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></figure></div>



<p>4. Click on three dots and select <strong>View breakdowns/tags</strong> option. <br>5. Once you click, the popup window will appear and in that table you will see the buy/purchase date of stock in the first column itself. If you have sell/buy the given stock multiple times then you might see multiple entries there. The latest one will be shown at the top. </p>



<p>As you can see the date is quite hidden in different option and need to dig deeper one level to know the date of purchase of given stock. I hope going forward, zerodha team will add a dedicated column to show the purchase date. </p>



<p>So this is what I wanted to share with this post. If found useful, please share. If you face any problem while performing above steps, let me know in comment section below. <br>Thanks for reading&#8230;.</p>
