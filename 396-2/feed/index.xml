					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://shreyasjejurkar.github.io/testwebsite/396-2/#comment-10&quot;&gt;shankar&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for referring my guide. BTW I don&#039;t have any experiance with VMware where I have very nice experience with VirtualBox. In which there is feature called as &#039;Shared Folder&#039; which acts like shared folder between host machine and guest machine and can share files easily between them. Hope so there is something like this in VMware.]]></description>
