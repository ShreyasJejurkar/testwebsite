So while developing an ASP.NET Core Web application (Or any .NET application) or debugging a bug, you might need to see a generated query for your LINQ operation, and most probably you might want to log in to console so that based on it you can decide do you want to write a raw SQL query for given complex operation or wanna use EF generated query.<br>So by default when you add the EF Core package to the application, it does not log the query to the console, we have to tell EF core explicitly to log the generated query to the console (or might be somewhere else).<br>So in today&#8217;s post how we will see how we can do that. There are generally two ways to do so. But let&#8217;s proceed with a simple one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1<sup>st<\/sup> way<\/strong>:<br>This is the simplest way to start logging your generated query.<br>In your <code>DbContext<\/code> class, you need to override the <code>OnConfiguring<\/code> method and need to add the following line to <code>optionsBuilder<\/code>. As we can see the <code>LogTo<\/code> (added in .NET 5) method takes <code>Action&lt;string&gt;<\/code> as a parameter. For simplicity, I am logging queries to Console but you can log it anywhere and second parameter we have to pass the <code>LogLevel<\/code>. By adding this, the EF core will start logging generated SQL to Console. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\"> protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\n        {\n            optionsBuilder\n                .EnableSensitiveDataLogging()\n                .LogTo(Console.WriteLine, LogLevel.Information);\n\n            base.OnConfiguring(optionsBuilder);\n        }<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2<sup>nd<\/sup> way<\/strong>:<br>This way is quite simple and configurable as well. In the previous method as we see we need to modify the actual C# code to tell EF to start logging generated SQL but in this way, we just need to add an entry in the Logging section under appsettings.json file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\"> \"Logging\": {\n    \"LogLevel\": {\n      \"Default\": \"Information\",\n      \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\",\n      \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Information\",\n      \"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command\": \"Information\"\n    }\n  },<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After adding the above entry, the Logger abstraction will read this configuration at startup and will start logging EF generated SQL.<br>One of the advantages of this is like, in production scenarios if we don&#8217;t want to log the generated SQL to console, so in that, we just need to remove or comment out this entry in JSON file, by doing so the EF will no longer log the generated SQL and this does not require the application restart, as the configuration will automatically get reloaded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By following any of the steps mentioned above, you will see generated SQL to logs.
